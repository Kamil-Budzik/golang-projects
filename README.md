# Golang projects

## Projects

- `htmx-test` - Just testing htmx, nothing worth checking
- `gin-playground` - Playing around with GIN, nothing special
- `event-booking` - project from go-course, CRUD app with DB connection and user Auth via JWT
- `sudoku-solver` - Sudoku solver app with Go backend and Svelte frontend
## Project Ideas

1. **Full working CRUD app with User auth and DB written on my own with different framework, add File Storage Service**
2. **Cloud based CRUD app**
3. **Chat Platform with web sockets and data encryption**
