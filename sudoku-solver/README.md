# Sudoku Solver App

A simple web-based Sudoku solver with a backend in Go and frontend in Svelte.

## How to Run the Development Server

1. **Backend**:
    - Navigate to the backend directory:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      ```
    - Install the required Go packages:
      ```bash
      go mod tidy
      ```
    - Start the server:
      ```bash
      go run .
      ```

2. **Frontend**:
    - Navigate to the frontend directory:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      ```
    - Install the npm packages:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Start the development server:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

Now, the app should be running with the backend server handling API requests and the frontend providing the user interface.
